A new Chinese coronavirus was likely elaborated in NATO biolabs,False Claim,"The false narrative is: ""A new coronavirus coincides with a number of significant events in the world, including the WEF’s Davos Forum in Switzerland. It must not be a coincidence, just as it was with H1N1 virus and others. This is all business aimed at the creation of specific political and economic situation. There are many American and NATO biological laboratories around China. They study human saliva, the genome of humans representing specific race. Japanese media write that the new virus infects only Chinese. Global fights are not ethical, everything can be used. Back into 1950-1960s, China released posters saying: “Everyone to struggle with American bacteriological aggression!”, this is coming back. Soon the new coronavirus will be linked to ecology… They will say that the presence of European specialists at Chinese industrial enterprises is needed in order for the Chinese goods to be exported to the US and Europe."" This is a conspiracy theory aimed to cast a shadow at the US / NATO as likely purposeful creators of the new virus pursuing political and economic aims. So far nothing suggests that this was the case. Coronaviruses are well known to science. They are a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses, rarely evolving and spreading from animals to humans. In a new study in the Journal of Medical Virology, researchers sequenced the genes of 2019-nCoV (as the new coronavirus is now called) and suggested that 2019-nCoV likely originated in snakes. Hence the likeliest version so far is that the virus began to spread from Wuhan's local seafood and animal market.",https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/a-new-chinese-coronavirus-was-likely-elaborated-in-nato-biolabs/,1/22/2020,"https://sputnik.by/video/20200122/1043758449/Ne-veryu-chto-eto-sluchayno-ekspert-o-proiskhozhdenii-koronavirusa.html, globalresearch.ca, Sputnik Belarus @ Novosti Shiolkovog","China, US","coronavirus, Conspiracy theory, Virus / bacteria threat, EU, NATO",,,,Western countries are likely to be purposeful creators of the new virus. ,Global,"sputnik.by, globalresearch.ca",Website,"https://sputnik.by/video/20200122/1043758449/Ne-veryu-chto-eto-sluchayno-ekspert-o-proiskhozhdenii-koronavirusa.html, globalresearch.ca, Sputnik Belarus @ Novosti Shiolkovog",
The new coronavirus is a US biological weapon,False Claim,"The false narrative is: ""The appearance of coronavirus could be the result of the use of an American biological weapon. Recall the scandal in 2010, when one of the 400 American military biological laboratories deployed around the world was closed in Indonesia because it was conducting secret experiments with the bird flu virus. When the virus emerged from the laboratory and a serious pandemic began, the United States refused to provide information about its work to the Indonesian Ministry of Health."" This is not the first time the claims that the United States is creating a biological weapon appear. It has been stated before in several pro-kremlin articles and talk shows, especially to comment on the story onSkripal poisoning and also todiscredit the account of Yulia Skripal. The comments about the US creating a biological weapon against Russians come from Igor Nikulin, who is usually presented as a former inspector of the UN Commission on Chemical, Bacteriological and Biological Weapons. According to Russian website “the Insider”, Nikulin has no connection with the UN. Furthermore, on his website, Nikulin describes himself as a supporter of a monarchy in Russia and proclaims his alleged descent from the ancient Rurik dynasty. In early 2008, the Indonesian Health Minister, Siti Fadilah Supari, has claimed in her book, that the United States and the World Health Organisation are part of aglobal conspiracy to profit from the spread of bird flu and the US may use samples to produce biological weapons. Because much of the claims were groundless, the president of the country ordered the Book to be withdrawn from the market. And after publishing an English version of the same book, the Indonesian Minister of Health stated that the book shall be also withdrawn from the market. Siti Fadilah claimed that there were ""mistranslated phrases that don't match the Indonesian version"", and therefore the book needed to be retracted.",https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/the-new-corona-virus-is-a-us-biological-weapon/,1/23/2020,"https://sptnkne.ws/BeAT, realfarmacy.com, Sputnik web Arabic, tvzvezda, tsargrad, akhbarelyom, burathanews, emeknes, bawabaa, elbayan-news, abudhabi-news, jpnews-sy, saadaonline, news-araby,sabq-sa, uk-arabicnews, miralnews, bbcnews1, albidda, masr20, arabyoum","China, US","coronavirus, Conspiracy theory, Virus / bacteria threat, Biological weapons",,,,Western countries are likely to be purposeful creators of the new virus. ,Global,"sptnkne.ws, realfarmacy.com, tvzvezda.ru, tsargrad.tv, akhbarelyom.com, burathanews.com, emeknes.com, bawabaa.org, elbayan-news.com, abudhabi-news.com, jpnews-sy.com, saadaonline.net, news-araby.com ,sabq-sa.com, uk-arabicnews.com, miralnews.com, bbcnews1.com, albidda.net, masr20.com, arabyoum.com",Website,"https://sptnkne.ws/BeAT, realfarmacy.com, Sputnik web Arabic, tvzvezda, tsargrad, akhbarelyom, burathanews, emeknes, bawabaa, elbayan-news, abudhabi-news, jpnews-sy, saadaonline, news-araby,sabq-sa, uk-arabicnews, miralnews, bbcnews1, albidda, masr20, arabyoum",

Coronavirus: A North American epidemic,False Claim,"The false narrative is: ""There are strange “separate” incidents that targeted China from North America; the most prominent was the arrival of a shipment issued by Canadian biological laboratories in March 2019, which includes “malicious viruses.” It is noteworthy that this shipment was carried out under a veil of secrecy other than the usual procedures, which prompted the Chinese side to file a formal complaint. A large US military delegation, consisting of 300 people, arrived in Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China on October 19, 2019, to participate in a military games festival hosted by China and held there. On November 2, 2019, the first infection with the coronavirus was recorded in that province, and it spread rapidly throughout December. Scientifically, the incubation period for corona infection is 14 days."" A number of conspiracy theories that are only linked by the fact that they are ""separate"" incidents, and echos some recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation especially about China coronavirus. The narratives also resemble a recurring conspiracy theory about the Lugar Lab in Georgia. The claims about Canadian involvement in the coronavirus spread appear to be based on a mischaracterization of August 2019 reports about a transfer of Ebola and Nipah viruses from a Canadian lab to Beijing, and an apparently separate issue involving two Chinese researchers at Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, in the central province of Manitoba. Read further debunking by the AFP Fact Check. As for the US participation in the Military World Games and its connection with the coronavirus, there is no evidence to prove this claim. There were 9,308 athletes from 109 countries that have registered to participate in 2019 Military World Games held between October 18-27. While the incubation period of 2019-nCoV, also known as coronavirus, is believed to vary from as few as 2 days to as long as 14 days after the exposure, according to the CDC. This is based on what has been seen previously as the incubation period of MERS viruses. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the first reported unusual cluster of pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan was recorded on 31 December 2019, when Chinese authorities confirmed they wereinvestigating 27 cases of viral pneumonia, which is 65 days after the closing ceremony of the Military World Games.",https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/coronavirus-a-north-american-epidemic/,2/1/2020,"http://www.almayadeen.net/news/politics/1377820/وقائع-مريبة-رافقت-كورونا---من-كان-يعرف, ripostelaique.com, french.presstv.com, presstv.com, almayadeen, katehon, annabaa, azzaman, al-binaa, shaamtimes, aleshraq, dampress, syrianownews, almajd, darhaya, arabitoday, alderaah-news, news-sinaa, elsob7, egysaudi, alsharqtimes","Cuba, Canada, China, US","coronavirus, Conspiracy theory, Biological weapons, Military, Conspiracy",,,,,,"almayadeen.net, katehon.com, annabaa.org, azzaman.com, al-binaa.net, shaamtimes.net, aleshraq.tv, dampress.net, syrianownews.com, almajd.net, darhaya.com, arabitoday.com, alderaah-news.net, news-sinaa.org, elsob7.news, egysaudi.com, alsharqtimes.com",Website,"http://www.almayadeen.net/news/politics/1377820/وقائع-مريبة-رافقت-كورونا---من-كان-يعرف, ripostelaique.com, french.presstv.com, presstv.com, almayadeen, katehon, annabaa, azzaman, al-binaa, shaamtimes, aleshraq, dampress, syrianownews, almajd, darhaya, arabitoday, alderaah-news, news-sinaa, elsob7, egysaudi, alsharqtimes",
The US owns the coronavirus and its cure,False Claim,"The false claim is: ""Coronavirus is an American product par excellence, according to the registry of inventions submitted in 2015, which was approved in 2018."" This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the US and about the coronavirus. The claim that the United States has patented and owns the coronavirus goes back to viral incorrect claims that the virus, along with its vaccine is owned by the Pirbright Institute (a research institute in the UK), was funded by the American Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The institute works to prevent viral diseases of livestock. The Pirbright Institute clarified that they don’t work with human coronaviruses and that a patent that they hold is unrelated to the current coronavirus linked to Wuhan. The patent that the story links to - No. 10,130,701 - is for a mutated form of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a different coronavirus that infects poultry, but not people. That patent was filed by the Pirbright Institute, but not funded by the Gates Foundation, and the mutations were created to weaken the virus so that it could be used as a vaccine to protect chickens from IBV. Matthew Frieman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Maryland, told FactCheck.org that the patent has nothing to do with the new 2019-nCoV virus. The American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention explains that the name of new coronavirus comes from the crown, or corona-like appearance of infective viruses when seen under a microscope. The CDC told the Associated Press in 2003 that the agency was claiming ownership of a patent related to a virus that causes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease that spread to dozens of countries in 2003, in result of which more than 8,000 people got ill and 774 people died), in order to ensure access and to prevent others from controlling the technology.",https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/us-owns-the-coronavirus-and-its-cure/,2/1/2020,"http://www.almayadeen.net/news/politics/1377820/وقائع-مريبة-رافقت-كورونا---من-كان-يعرف, https://www.azzaman.com/فرضية-تتحدث-عن-هجوم-بايولوجي-أمريكي-ي/, https://shaamtimes.net/221531/وقائع-مريبةرافقت-كورونا-من-كان-يعرف؟/, http://almajd.net/2020/02/01/وباء-كورونا-أخطار-تطوير-الأسلحة-البيو/, https://darhaya.com/news/2020/02/02/11420/وباء-كورونا-مخاطر-تطوير-الأسلحة-البيولوجية, https://www.arabitoday.com/2020/02/وقائع-مريبة-رافقت-كورونا-من-كان-يعرف؟/, almayadeen, katehon, annabaa, azzaman, al-binaa, shaamtimes, aleshraq, dampress, syrianownews, almajd, darhaya, arabitoday, alderaah-news, news-sinaa, elsob7, egysaudi, alsharqtimes","China, US","coronavirus, Conspiracy theory, Virus / bacteria threat, Bill Gates, Biological weapons, Conspiracy",,,,,,"almayadeen.net, azzaman.com, shaamtimes.net, almajd.net, darhaya.com, arabitoday.com katehon.com, annabaa.org, azzaman.com, al-binaa, shaamtimes.net, aleshraq.tv, dampress.net, syrianownews.com, almajd.com, darhaya.net, arabitoday.com, alderaah-news.com, news-sinaa.org, elsob7.news, egysaudi.com, alsharqtimes.com",Website,"http://www.almayadeen.net/news/politics/1377820/وقائع-مريبة-رافقت-كورونا---من-كان-يعرف, https://www.azzaman.com/فرضية-تتحدث-عن-هجوم-بايولوجي-أمريكي-ي/, https://shaamtimes.net/221531/وقائع-مريبةرافقت-كورونا-من-كان-يعرف؟/, http://almajd.net/2020/02/01/وباء-كورونا-أخطار-تطوير-الأسلحة-البيو/, https://darhaya.com/news/2020/02/02/11420/وباء-كورونا-مخاطر-تطوير-الأسلحة-البيولوجية, https://www.arabitoday.com/2020/02/وقائع-مريبة-رافقت-كورونا-من-كان-يعرف؟/, almayadeen, katehon, annabaa, azzaman, al-binaa, shaamtimes, aleshraq, dampress, syrianownews, almajd, darhaya, arabitoday, alderaah-news, news-sinaa, elsob7, egysaudi, alsharqtimes",

Coronavirus is the West’s revenge for China refusing to become hostile towards Russia,False Claim,"The false narrative is: ""The new coronavirus is a comprehensive, multi-factor special operation by UK-US alliance. Brexit and coronavirus are linked because Britain’s exit from the EU allows the UK not to face losses to be inflicted by coronavirus upon the EU. The people in charge of the operation ‘coronavirus’ decide if the virus should spread to Belarus or not. Since 2013 China has attempted to go away from the strategy imposed by the West, namely the confrontation with Russia. The West boosted China with the aim to throw it against Russia. To constrain China, thanks to the hysteria around coronavirus and growing Sinophobia, soon the West will start blocking Chinese trade routes and make the presence of Chinese business in Europe more problematic."" This is a conspiracy theory, one of a dozen of other similar cases about the coronavirus, which is consistent with the narrative that the spread of coronavirus is a controlled operation by the US, UK, and the West to weaken China economically. Furthermore, it follows a recurring propagandistic narrative about the West's anti-Russian activities. The claim that the West has been pushing China to wage war against Russia which Beijing ultimately refused to do, is groundless.

In UK the Porton Down laboratory, a quite well known organisation which has been dealing with chemical and biological weapons for a long time has said they already have the vaccine. According to media, they have patented it already one year ago! This is the same organisation which put the poison on the Skripals’ door handle. Probably they put something also over the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, for example, on the door handle of the subway, or rather not the door handle but this one [thing, object] which is being touched by thousands of people. Unfortunately, we can’t exclude such a situation. It can be an act of biological sabotage, it might have been carried out not by a State, for example, the US, but by certain private corporations. The appearance of such beneficiaries able to go on market already tomorrow with an already made vaccine is a not direct proof of that.""

Coronavirus is an attempt by the Anglo-Saxons to control China,False Claim,"The false claim is: ""Coronavirus is linked to the opium wars when Chinese emperors wanted to prevent the access of the British empire to Chinese domestic ports. China’s opening up happened through the active spread of opium. Today, similarly, international organisations and private medical foundations openly call on China to give them access to Chinese industrial zones saying: we will sort it out ourselves and find a vaccination.

This is a coronavirus-related conspiracy theory aimed to discredit the West and the so-called Anglo-Saxons.

Burns went out to make the most scientifically accurate version of a pandemic thriller he could, enlisting doctors W. Ian Lipkin and Larry Brilliant to help create an imaginary virus based on both science and their firsthand experiences within the field of epidemiology.

Amsterdam may use coronavirus to commit frauds against Russia in the MH17 trial,False Claim,"The false narrative here is that the West may use coronavirus to commit frauds against Russia in the MH17 trial, and that it could intentionally ban Russian representatives from attending the court hearing and suppress the public speaking of the 13 so-called unnamed witnesses, and that the Coronavirus may also become a pretext for provocations against Russia in court. No evidence is given. This is a conspiracy theory about the coronavirus, and one of many recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives aiming to undermine the results of the MH17 investigation and the outcomes of the future trial. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) - which is comprised of the Dutch Public Prosecution Service officials and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine - has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17 originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation.

Historically liberal societies have been at the forefront of scientific breakthroughs that have brought about tremendous advancements in public health in the 19th and 20th centuries. The development of modern science in the West, including the growth of scientific knowledge about the causes and the means of controlling disease, is closely related to liberalism.

On the other hand, there is mounting evidence that pro-Kremlin media are spreading disinformation on the disease for political purposes through a coordinated campaign. The mortality rate of the coronavirus has varied by country and estimates differ, however, it is more deadly than most strains of the flu. Since it is a new disease, humans do not have any immunity to it. The rapid spread of the virus around the world threatens to overwhelm public health systems, particularly in poorer countries, resulting in more deaths and other adverse societal and economic impacts.

Parents can receive a case of baby formula during the COVID-19 pandemic by calling the number on the back of the company's product.,False Claim,"The false claim is: ""Parents can receive a case of baby formula during the COVID-19 pandemic by calling the number on the back of the company's product."" In March 2020, as the COVID-19 coronavirus disease continued to spread around the globe, worried citizens started to stock up on supplies to “wait out the storm” in the relative safety of their homes. As store shelves were temporarily emptied, a viral message started to circulate on social media that claimed anyone looking for baby formula during this pandemic could obtain some by simply calling the number on the back of one of these products. This viral meme reads: “For parents who cannot find formula in stores for their babies right now grab the can of formula that you do have, and call the number on the back and they will send you a whole case during this time!” This is not true. You can’t receive a free case of baby formula simply by calling the number on the back of a product. This claim appears to have originated out of whole cloth (which means that it is a lie). One red flag that indicates this post contains faulty advice is that no specific company is identified in the message. We searched the websites of some of the larger baby formula brands, such as Gerber and Enfamil, and found no announcements about how parents could obtain baby formula via this method during the pandemic. The Motherload, a Facebook group for mothers, reached out to Aptamil Customer Services and quoted the company as saying the rumor was false.",https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/free-case-of-baby-formula/?collection-id=238774,3/16/2020,,,,,,,,,,"Facebook, Twitter",,

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a solution to coronavirus,False Claim,"The false claim is: ""Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a solution to the coronavirus."" A traditional Chinese medicine such as Shuanghuanglian is being touted as being able to inhibit the novel coronavirus. As scientists race to find a cure and vaccine, China is increasingly turning to its traditional remedies. Other TCM remedies that are being touted are buffalo horn, cow poop, kimchi, bear bile, and many others. There is no known cure for the coronavirus. Scientists are working to find ways to stamp out the deadly virus. But for now, the mainstream antiviral treatments focus on relieving the symptoms, which is where some of these TCM remedies may help. Again, however, TCM is NOT ""a solution"" to the coronavirus. Beginning on January 28, 2020, Chinese state media began an information campaign on the social media platform Webo to support their claims of the effectiveness of TCM. The four Weibo posts marked the beginning of a long lasting campaign to support the claim that TCM was key to fighting COVID-19. Over the ensuing three months, Chinese state media posted 201 times across 55 accounts on the subject. The posts appeared on Reddit, Facebook, YouTube, RSS, Instagram, Weibo, and Twitter. In line with China’s IO campaign “Chinese Scientific Prowess Coveted Around The World” (2019-11-18 to 2020-02-12 with 3,751 posts), the focus on TCM’s efficacy was international. Posts came in 11 languages, only a quarter of which were in Chinese.

Coronavirus did not spread in the US because of an anti-Trump conspiracy. In a March 10 episode of the podcast “The NutriMedical Report,” commentator Josh Bernstein claimed the spread of COVID-19 in the United States was the result of a conspiracy between the Democratic Party and Chinese government. “I believe that because Russia didn’t work, and Ukraine didn’t work, and impeachment didn’t work, they are so hell-bent on destroying this country (and) this president to gain back power that they probably worked with the Chinese government, and they devised this plan,” Bernstein said.

The coronavirus came from outer space,False Claim,"The false claim is: ""The coronavirus came from outer space."" With the coronavirus pandemic continuing to spread around the globe, people are panicked, and they're looking for answers and explanations. One wild theory that has made its way around the web is that the virus came from space. Recently, Chandra Wickramasinghe, known for his work in astronomy and astrobiology, spread the idea that the virus was living on a comet and a piece of that space rock may have fallen to Earth during a brief fireball event over China in October 2019. He further implied that comets carrying viruses may have caused outbreaks in the past as well. In the past, Wickramasinghe has asserted that another disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) also came from space. He even co-wrote a book with Fred Hoyle in the 1970s called ""Diseases from Space"" and, for decades, has tried to prove that diseases like SARS or influenza have come from space. However, scientists have rebuked Wickramasinghe's suggestions that any such illness might have extraterrestrial origins, and his ideas have largely been considered pseudoscience or ""bad science."" It would be unprecedented to discover that a virus could survive the radiation it would be exposed to on such a long journey through space (never mind the trip back to Earth) and still be able to infect humans after it landed, astrobiologist Graham Lau, who hosts NASA's ""Ask an Astrobiologist"" series, told Space.com. However, while it would be an incredibly unique and groundbreaking finding if this were true, Wickramasinghe simply does not have evidence to support his claims, Lau said. ""It's one of those cases where extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,"" Lau told Space.com. ""Even though it's an interesting idea, we just don't have any reason to embrace that idea right now. ""I think it's important for scientists to point out pseudoscientists or bad science,"" Lau added. ""If this was real, it'd be great, but we just can't allow ourselves to jump to the feel-good conclusion without doing our due diligence as scientists.""",https://www.space.com/coronavirus-not-from-outer-space.html,3/17/2020,"Chandra Wickramasinghe, https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1240664/coronavirus-news-latest-china-origin-meteorite-scientists-health-warning-death-toll-latest?fbclid=IwAR3A-JiOCofsU979MAGIkIogqsjRC27GijjAXLFBKj4wbL7mIlIYWgzbjrE",,,,,,,,express.co.uk,Website,"Chandra Wickramasinghe, https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1240664/coronavirus-news-latest-china-origin-meteorite-scientists-health-warning-death-toll-latest?fbclid=IwAR3A-JiOCofsU979MAGIkIogqsjRC27GijjAXLFBKj4wbL7mIlIYWgzbjrE",

Avoid ibuprofen if you're infected with the coronavirus,False Claim,"The false claim is: ""Avoid ibuprofen if you're infected with the coronavirus."" This false claim came from a reputable source -- Olivier Véran, the health minister of France. He tweeted on March 14 that taking anti-inflammatory medicines, such as ibuprofen or cortisone, ""could be a factor in worsening the infection"" (quote translated from French). If you have a fever, he says, take paracetamol (also know as acetaminophen or Tylenol in the US). Some media outlets also reported that the WHO agreed with Véran. Truth: The European Medicines Agency issued a statement saying there isn't any scientific evidence that taking ibuprofen or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could worse a coronavirus infection. The UK's National Health Service backed up that statement. Other experts have weighed in, saying there's no data that suggests ibuprofen makes the infection worse.

"If you can hold your breath for 10 seconds, you don't have a coronavirus infection",False Claim,"The false claim is: ""If you can hold your breath for 10 seconds, you don't have a coronavirus infection."" The idea behind this myth is that if some is infected with coronavirus, by the time someone is having trouble breathing, 50% of their lungs will have pulmonary fibrosis -- a lung disease that causes irreversible scarring and hardening of the lung tissue. There's a post that's been floating around the internet that states that if you can hold your breath for 10 seconds -- without feeling like you need to gasp for air or a tightness in your chest -- then you don't have pulmonary fibrosis and you're likely not infected with coronavirus. This false myth has been shared all over social media, including by actress Debra Messing who posted it on a now-deleted Instagram story. There are even reports that the advice came from Stanford University, but that's completely false according to the med school. Truth: While it's possible for the coronavirus to cause fibrosis, holding your breath is not a suitable at-home ""test"" to determine if you have lung damage. To get a proper diagnosis, you'd need a variety of tests performed by your doctor. And, if you're having difficulty breathing, from coronavirus or anything else, you should call your healthcare provider.",https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/8-coronavirus-health-myths-fact-checked/ar-BB11qFir,3/19/2020,,,,,,,,,,"Facebook, Twitter",,

There are several things we know that can protect people from getting or transmitting the novel coronavirus: washing your hands with soap for 20 seconds frequently, cleaning surfaces in your home with disinfecting products and social isolation. But according to posts all over social media, there are many more ways to protect yourself. Well before the coronavirus was named a pandemic by the WHO, people started sharing all sorts of questionable advice on how to protect yourself from getting infected, ranging from misguided (like making your own hand sanitizer) to outright dangerous (like drinking bleach).

Bovine coronavirus has been around for years. It is not the same as the novel coronavirus causing the current pandemic, it is merely in the same family. According to the CDC, coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. “Coronavirus” is a term for a group of diseases. Seven different kinds of human coronaviruses exist, including 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1. Most human coronaviruses cause “mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses,” similar to the common cold. In different species, coronaviruses can produce “a wide spectrum of disease syndromes.” The CDC mentions that: “Sometimes coronaviruses that infect animals can evolve and make people sick and become a new human coronavirus.

Less than a month after taking steps to permanently ban the trade and consumption of live wild animals for food, the Chinese government has recommended using Tan Re Qing, an injection containing bear bile, to treat severe and critical COVID-19 cases. It is one of a number of recommended coronavirus treatments—both traditional and Western—on a list published March 4 by China’s National Health Commission, the government body responsible for national health policy. This recommendation highlights what wildlife advocates say is a contradictory approach to wildlife: shutting down the live trade in animals for food on the one hand and promoting the trade in animal parts on the other. Secreted by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, bile from various species of bears, including Asiatic black bears and brown bears, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine since at least the eighth century. It contains high levels of ursodeoxycholic acid, also known as ursodiol, which is clinically proven to help dissolve gallstones and treat liver disease.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow). At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are examples of diseases caused by coronaviruses that originated in animals and spread to people. This is what is suspected to have happened with the virus that caused the current outbreak of COVID-19. However, we do not know the exact source of this virus. Public health officials and partners are working hard to identify the source of COVID-19. The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person to person. The coronavirus most similar to the virus causing COVID-19 is the one that causes SARS. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread COVID-19 or that they might be a source of infection in the United States."" Additionally, the American Veterinary Medical Association states: ""While 2 dogs (Hong Kong) and 1 cat (Belgium) have been reported to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, infectious disease experts and multiple international and domestic human and animal health organizations agree there is no evidence at this point to indicate that pets spread COVID-19 to other animals, including people. If you are not ill with COVID-19, you can interact with your pet as you normally would, including walking, feeding, and playing. You should continue to practice good hygiene during those interactions (e.g., wash hands before and after interacting with your pet; ensure your pet is kept well-groomed; regularly clean your pet’s food and water bowls, bedding material, and toys). Out of an abundance of caution, it is recommended that those ill with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. Have another member of your household take care of walking, feeding, and playing with your pet.

"The TV show ""My Secret Terrius"" predicted coronavirus",False Claim,"The false claim is: ""The TV show 'My Secret Terrius' predicted coronavirus."" This is false. In March 2020, social media users started sharing clips from the 2018 South Korean television show “My Secret Terrius,” which supposedly showed characters using the word “coronavirus.” This is a real scene from a 2018 show. But while many people may have only heard the word “coronavirus” for the first time in 2020, it has been around for decades. Scientists first identified human coronaviruses in humans in the 1960s. Since then, we’ve seen a few coronavirus outbreaks, such as the MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2012 and the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2002. In a longer version of this clip, the TV doctor explains how these diseases all come from the same group of viruses. The fictional coronavirus in the show is also rather different from the strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) that was spreading around the globe in early 2020. In the show, someone “tweaked” the virus in order to make it more deadly. In reality, that simply isn’t possible. COVID-19 is not a human-made bioweapon. The coronavirus in the show also has a 90% mortality rate. While we still have a lot to learn about COVID-19, the disease does not have a 90% mortality rate. The case fatality rate differs from country to country and can be influenced by various factors, such as the availability of supplies at hospitals. In places like Italy, where the outbreak has been severe, the fatality rate has climbed as high as 11%. In places like South Korea, where outbreaks were mitigated with a massive testing program, the fatality rate has been just over 1%. We should also note that some social media users shared clips of “My Secret Terrius” along with the claim that this was a “Chinese” show. While that may play into the human-made bioweapon conspiracy theory (again, that is a false rumor), this show actually comes from South Korea.",https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/secret-terrius-predict-covid19/,4/2/2020,"https://twitter.com/harbhajan_singh, https://twitter.com/eoeoes, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8SNxSMK6vQ",Global,,,,,Virus was predicted in the past.,Global,,"Twitter, YouTube","https://twitter.com/harbhajan_singh, https://twitter.com/eoeoes, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8SNxSMK6vQ",

Face masks don't work,False Claim,"The false claim is: ""Face masks don't work."" Wearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness). If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re showing symptoms of coronavirus, or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. So masks are crucial for health and social care workers looking after patients and are also recommended for family members who need to care for someone who is ill – ideally both the patient and carer should have a mask.A face mask isn’t guaranteed to keep you from getting sick, but the protection is better than nothing. A mask can help capture some droplets that carry the virus. And it’s important to note that wearing a mask isn’t just about protecting yourself; it can also help keep you from passing viruses to others. This coronavirus seems to be spread even by people who aren’t showing symptoms. As of Friday morning, April 3, the White House coronavirus task force was formalizing new guidance to recommend that many Americans wear face coverings of some kind — even T-shirts or bandannas — when going outside or to places like grocery stores or pharmacies. Even if you’re wearing a mask, make sure to follow social distancing and hygiene guidelines recommended by public health officials; for instance, stay at least 6 feet from other people, wash your hands often and don’t touch your face. Make sure you know how to use your mask and keep it clean. Wash your hands thoroughly before touching it. Medical-grade masks — particularly N-95 masks, which are the most effective but are in short supply — should be reserved for medical professionals who deal directly with sick patients.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/face-mask-protect-coronavirus-covid-19-myths-busted,4/5/2020,#NAME?,,,,,,,Global,,Twitter,#NAME?,

Additionally, and even more concerning, the virus can remain viable on surfaces for variable periods of time, according to Dr. Fauci – from a few hours for cloth to up to two or three days for hard surfaces like stainless steel and certain types of plastic. “People also continually touch their nose or mouth,” Dr. Fauci says. “They shake hands with people, they grab a doorknob – that’s also the way it’s transmitted.”",https://baptisthealth.net/baptist-health-news/myths-vs-facts-about-covid-19/,4/6/2020,,,,,,,,Global,,,,Unable to find specific platform for claim online

Hackers Are Sending Fake HIV Results And Coronavirus Emails To Infect People’s Computers,Scam,"This is an active situation. Hackers are sending emails with fake HIV results and coronavirus information that infect computers with malware, according to research from cybersecurity research firm Proofpoint. The fake HIV emails are designed to look like they come from Vanderbilt University, possibly to exploit the credibility of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The emails, which include an attached spreadsheet labeled “test results,” have been sent to insurance, health care, and pharmaceutical companies.

Although the emails mainly targeted industries such as manufacturing, transportation, health care, and higher education, it is important that citizens be aware.

"Stimulus checks will later be taxed or you will automatically owe $1,200 next tax season.",False Claim,"The false claim is: ""Stimulus checks will later be taxed."" Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration’s spokesperson Scott Hardin confirmed that the check will not be taxed by the state or federal government. This false claim is also being spread nationally. The national false claim is: ""The federal payments from the COVID-19 stimulus package is just an advance on your next tax return--Next year, you’re automatically going to owe $1,200 come tax season."" This is false. The Internal Revenue Service says the payment “will not reduce your refund or increase the amount you owe when you file your 2020 tax return next year.” The IRS has begun dispersing money from the $2 trillion COVID-19 economic stimulus package. But memes and videos on social media are spreading misleading messages about made-up consequences for those who receive the payments. A common claim in these posts is that payouts from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act — which provides $1,200 lump-sum payments to most individuals making less than $75,000 a year — will either reduce future tax refunds or will have to be paid back. One viral video originally posted on TikTok has been taken down from that site, but continues to circulate on Facebook, making the claim: “See, what they don’t tell you is that this is just an advance on your next tax return… Next year, you’re automatically going to owe $1,200 come tax season.” That’s not true. The claim in the video appears to stem from a misunderstanding of the language in the law, which uses a tax credit as the vehicle to get stimulus payments to individuals.

Dr. Jennings Ryan Staley, who runs Skinny Beach Med Spa in Carmel Valley, allegedly called his treatment — which included the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine — a “magic bullet” and “miracle cure” that was “perfectly engineered,” according to an FBI agent’s probable cause statement. Staley allegedly advertised the treatment as a “concierge medical package” that costs $3,995 for a family of four, and allegedly shipped the undercover agent a package containing hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, generic versions of Xanax and Viagra, and azithromycin — an antibiotic often called a Z-Pak that’s used to treat sexually transmitted infections and other conditions — which Trump has also promoted as a potential coronavirus treatment. “It’s preventative and curative. It’s hard to believe, it’s almost too good to be true,” Staley told the undercover FBI agent during an April 3 phone call, according to court documents. “But it’s a remarkable clinical phenomenon.” The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, but on March 28 authorized its use on a limited, emergency basis. The FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine only from the Strategic National Stockpile, and only for hospitalized COVID-19 patients “for whom a clinical trial is not available, or participation is not feasible.” Prosecutors say Staley obtained his hydroxychloroquine by smuggling it from China and allegedly said patients could take it to cure COVID-19 or ward off the disease.",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/courts/story/2020-04-16/feds-charge-san-diego-physician-who-allegedly-offered-covid-19-miracle-cure,4/16/2020,Dr. Jennings Ryan Staley,Global,,,,,Scam hydroxychloroquine product to prevent or cure coronavirus.,Global,,"Verbal, Website, TV",,
Russians are Immune to Coronavirus,False Claim,"The false claim is: ""Russians are Immune to Coronavirus."" This is false. The Russian news community was found to have employed a sophisticated network of Social Media users to push misinformation regarding possible COVID-19 medication and vaccines. In a series of stories that broke in early April, major Russian media sites such as Vesti and RIA repeatedly claimed that the Russian population is immune to Coronavirus due to their use of the Description Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine since the 1950’s. Standard Russian disinformation tactics of mass dissemination and repetition, across VKontakte and Twitter, spread news of a “successful” COVID-19 vaccine developed by the Russian Government’s Research Center (also known as Vector). The narrative was pushed with a sense of urgency to counter conversations spread over Telegram that alleged that “coronavirus was created in the Vector laboratory in the science city of Koltsovo near Novosibirsk.” This rumor was started by the video maker, Alexander Thorne, who has since been a target of a Russian government’s investigation.",https://medium.com/@ryan.paterson/russia-stirs-distrust-in-latest-covid-19-narratives-6ae20613fffa,4/13/2020,"Telegram, Twitter, VKontakte, Vesti, RIA, drom",Russia,,,,,Specific nationalities or ethnicities are immune to coronavirus.,Russia,"vesti-online.com, ria.ru, drom.ru","Telegram, Twitter, Website",,

President Donald Trump’s advisor, Kellyanne Conway stated this during a ""Fox & Friends"" interview on April 15, 2020. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway implied that the WHO had 18 prior versions of the disease to prepare for COVID-19. This is false. According to the WHO, the designation “COVID-19” stands for Coronavirus Disease 2019, the year it was discovered. It does not refer to the 19th disease or virus. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, there are not 19 but only seven known human coronavirus strains. Four cause only mild to moderate symptoms, similar to the common cold. The CDC states that most people will be infected with these common coronaviruses in their lifetime, and most will recover. The other three coronaviruses originated as animal infections and caused widely reported outbreaks of serious disease after jumping to humans. They are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), in 2002-2003; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), 2012-now; and SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. The first severe human coronavirus outbreak was caused by SARS in China. It infected more than 8,000 people, killing nearly 800. Countries hit hard included China, Hong Kong and Singapore. The WHO released a consensus document on SARS in November 2003 to better understand how the disease worked. The agency, an arm of the United Nations, took steps to coordinate the study and response to future outbreaks. It established a SARS Risk Assessment and Preparedness Framework by October 2004. MERS is an ongoing coronavirus infection that has resulted in some 2,400 cases and 858 deaths since 2012. The virus has mostly been contained in the Mideast. COVID-19 is the largest severe coronavirus outbreak, with 2.4 million infected and almost 150,000 dead (as of April 22, 2020).",https://www.polygraph.info/a/are-there-19-coronaviruses-correcting-a-trump-adviser-/30570535.html,4/22/2020,White House adviser Kellyanne Conway,Global,,,,,Misinformation spread by White House advisor.,Global,,TV,"White House adviser Kellyanne Conway during April 15, 2020 ""Fox & Friends"" interview",
"""Blessing Looms"" scam",Scam,"Scammers use the “Blessing Looms” scam by posting it on social media and ask unwary readers to pay an entry fee (e.g., $100) with the promise that, as more people pay to build the pot of money by paying the entry fee, the participant will also get a payout (as much as $800) of that money. The surest way to identify these scams is if they promise large payouts in return for small investments, if they tell factually unsupported “success stories” of happy customers, or if they explain that future results rely on bringing in new participants to the scheme. Attorney General Rutledge has identified several tips for Arkansans to use in protecting themselves against Ponzi schemes: 1) If something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. Know that large sums of money generally do not result from small investments. 2) Consult the terms of use for Facebook and other social media platforms and report such scams as these platforms may prohibit schemes like this one. 3) Safeguard banking and financial information in order to prevent theft due to scams. 4) When using the internet, ensure that you are using a verified, secure, and encrypted website when sharing any personal or financial information online.

No, Pastor David Wilkerson did not predict that the COVID-19 pandemic would shut down the economy. The Times Square Church, where David Wilkerson was founder, stated that there was no record of him ever predicting this in any of his sermons, books or speeches. A Facebook post from the Jerusalem Prayer Team, an American Christian-Zionist organization  says a 1986 prophecy foretold of a plague like COVID-19 hitting New York City. The post says that David Wilkerson, the late founder of the Times Square Church, told Mike Evans, the leading pastor of the Jerusalem Prayer Team, the following: ""I see a plague coming on the world and the bars and church and government will shut down. The plague will hit New York City and shake it like it has never been shaken. The plague is going to force prayerless believers into radical prayer and into their Bibles and repentance will be the cry from the man of God in the pulpit. And out of it will come a third Great Awakening that will sweep America and the world."" There is no evidence that Wilkerson, who died in 2011, actually made this prediction.

A coronavirus vaccine has existed since 2001.,False Claim,"The false claim is: ""A coronavirus vaccine has existed since 2001."" This is false. A viral image on Facebook falsely suggests a vaccine exists for the novel coronavirus by referencing a photo of a vaccine for a coronavirus that infects dogs. The two viruses are not the same. The image was shared in various corners of Facebook, including in a group dedicated to the QAnon conspiracy theory. One user’s popular post claimed that a “CORONA VIRUS VACCINE EXIST SINCE 2001″ and “WE ARE BEING PLAYED BY THOSE ON THE TOP.” But the vaccine label in the photo clearly states “Canine Coronavirus Vaccine.” Like other instances of misinformation that have appeared since the outbreak began, the posts advance a false claim that centers on the term “coronavirus.” The term refers to a family of viruses, but they’re not all the same. The novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2 — which causes COVID-19 — was first reported in China in late 2019. The product in the viral photo is Nobivac 1-Cv, a vaccine sold by a subsidiary of Merck & Co. It protects dogs from the canine coronavirus, or CCV, a virus that typically causes a mild gastroenteritis, or inflammation in the intestines, in infected dogs. It was first identified in 1971.

Maatje Benassi, a US Army reservist and mother of two, has become the target of conspiracy theorists who falsely place her at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, saying she brought the disease to China. The false claims are spreading across YouTube every day, so far racking up hundreds of thousands of apparent views, and have been embraced by Chinese Communist Party media. Despite never having tested positive for the coronavirus or experienced symptoms, Benassi and her husband are now subjects of discussion on Chinese social media about the outbreak, including among accounts that are known drivers of large-scale coordinated activities by their followers. The claims have turned their lives upside down. The couple say their home address has been posted online and that, before they shut down their accounts, their social media inboxes were overrun with messages from believers of the conspiracy. It wasn't until March, months after the first reported coronavirus cases in China, that conspiracy theorists turned their focus to Maatje Benassi. The baseless theory began with her participation in October in the Military World Games, essentially the military Olympics, which was hosted by Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus outbreak began last year. Maatje Benassi competed in the cycling competition there, suffering an accident on the final lap that left her with a fractured rib and a concussion. Despite the crash, Benassi still finished the race, but it turned out to be the start of something worse.

Package delivery phishing scams use coronavirus lures.,Scam,"As people socially isolate and work from home, shopping online and home deliveries have increased. Scammers are capitalizing on this by creating new scams using Coronavirus delivery issues as a lure to get people to visit malicious links or open malware. In a new report by Kaspersky, researchers see a new wave of phishing scams that utilize a COVID-19 theme and impersonate well-known shipping carriers such as FedEx, UPS, and DHL. In one of the emails seen by Kaspersky, attackers impersonate DHL and state a package was being held due to the government lockdown during the Coronavirus crisis. It then prompts the users to make corrections to the attachment shipping document, which will then install the Bsymem Trojan. Another email found by BleepingComputer pretends to be from FedEx and states that due to the Coronavirus ""lock-down"", a package is being held at the warehouse. They then prompt the user to click on a phishing link to reschedule for pick up.

Any virus that originated from nature has its remedy and cure from nature.

Widely shared posts online are making false statements about viruses. The Facebook and Instagram posts, which have been shared thousands of times, are attempting to sow doubt around the coronavirus as researchers rush to develop a vaccine against it. Human viruses like measles and polio have originated in nature and require vaccines, said Vincent Racaniello, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University. “To say that any virus that originated from nature has its remedy in nature, ignores the fact that all human viruses came from nature, and that we have made vaccines for many of them,” he said in an email. “I am unaware of any remedy from nature that prevents infection with any human virus.” The vaccine for yellow fever has been around since the 1930s, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

THE FACTS: Social media users are posting hoax 1-800 numbers, urging people to call and check the status of their checks. The Internal Revenue Service isn’t currently accepting phone calls because of the coronavirus. False posts containing 800 numbers vary slightly; one text post, for example, says all you need to do is call the number and check using “the last 4 of your SS.” Another says to enter the last four digits of a social security number along with a zip code. In reality, people who typically do not file a tax return, such as Social Security recipients, can visit a new tool on the IRS site to fill out a form that will allow the government to directly deposit the checks into your bank account. And on Wednesday, the IRS announced it was launching a “Get My Payment” site, where people can check the status of their relief check by entering basic, personal information including their social security number. The IRS has warned Americans of scam artists who might try to swindle you out of your relief check through fraudulent emails, text messages, websites or social media posts that request your banking or personal information.

This is false. In May 2020, as the drug Remdesivir was being explored as a potential treatment for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, a widespread social media post posited a sprawling conspiracy involving U.S. biopharmaceutical company Gilead, China, the international medical organization Unitaid, George Soros, Bill Gates, the World Health Organization, Hillary Clinton, and National Institute of Allergy, and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci.

The flu vaccine doesn’t work because the flu has not been eliminated.,False Claim,"The false claim is: ""The flu vaccine doesn’t work because the flu has not been eliminated."" This is incorrect. The flu vaccine prevents illness and deaths. However, it can only protect against some of the ever-changing viruses that cause the flu. A post shared on Facebook claims that the flu vaccine “clearly doesn’t work” because “the flu shot hasn’t eliminated the flu”. This, the post claims, contradicts reports that “we can’t get rid of Covid-19 without a vaccine”. The post ends by asking readers to consider not getting the new coronavirus vaccine when it arrives. However, the argument that this post appears to be making—that we shouldn’t rely on a Covid-19 vaccine because people still die from the flu, which does have a vaccine—doesn’t add up. Unlike influenza, Covid-19 is caused by one single virus: officially called the “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2”, or SARS-CoV-2. That means that any Covid-19 vaccine, in contrast to the flu vaccines, will therefore have to target just one virus. That means it won’t face some of the challenges the annual flu vaccines face in predicting which of the many viruses in circulation to target.",https://fullfact.org/online/coronavirus-vaccine-compared-to-flu-vaccine/,5/5/2020,"Facebook, Vaccination Information Network (VINE)",,,,,,Attempt to spread idea of antivaccination.,,,Facebook,https://www.facebook.com/vaccinationinformationnetwork/posts/10159520608933998,

Claims on social media have been spreading the falsehood that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention significantly lowered the COVID-19 death toll. There has been no such reduction. These claims confuse two different measures of the number of deaths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regularly updates two different lists that track deaths from COVID-19 in the U.S. One list, referred to as “provisional deaths,” counts death certificates. The other list counts confirmed and probable cases. The list that counts death certificates shows a lower number partly because official documentation takes days or weeks to produce. So that number lags behind other methods of counting the death toll. But several claims based on a faulty comparison of those two lists have been spreading the falsehood that the CDC has “adjusted” or “reduced” the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the U.S. This message — made explicit in some posts and implicit in others — furthers the conspiracy theory that the pandemic was planned or is a hoax.",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/cdc-hasnt-reduced-covid-19-death-toll/,5/6/2020,"Facebook, Stephen Abernathy, Twitter, Dinesh D’Souza, Wayne Dupree, Walton And Johnson, Ken Webster jr, kprcradio",,,,,,Attempt to sow public distrust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).,,"waynedupree.com, kprcradio.iheart.com","Facebook, Twitter, Website, Radio","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10217618824805980&set=gm.1111394362555019&type=3&theater, https://twitter.com/DineshDSouza/status/1256641587708342274, https://www.waynedupree.com/cdc-covid-19-death-numbers/, https://kprcradio.iheart.com/featured/walton-and-johnson/content/2020-05-04-cdc-revised-the-covid19-deaths-from-65000-to-37000/?fbclid=IwAR3hWCvTUm_glu29ny2asZ29-aiDkyBTqVFQoHTUhDXzWdrE3Cq0ATp5Wm0",

Medicare pays hospitals based primarily on the diagnosis, and the amount is not affected by whether a patient dies.

This is not true! Face masks, including homemade ones, are effective COVID-19 protection, experts say. N95 masks offer the most protection from viral particles, health officials say, but they should be reserved for health care workers who are in direct contact with infected patients. Mask effectiveness varies, but claims that cloth masks provide 0% protection aren’t accurate. More studies need to be done to examine variables such as the material and fit of the mask, the wearer, and the environment.

This claim that the federal contact tracing bill is not for COVID-19 is false. A Facebook post claims new federal legislation to support contact tracing “is about controlling/tracking population, not about coronavirus.” The bill strictly targets the novel coronavirus. It would provide $100 billion to organizations that do COVID-19 contact tracing and testing, or that offer services to people who are isolating at home. Contact tracing has become a key strategy of the White House plan to reopen states that went into shutdown because of the coronavirus pandemic. The process tasks public health workers with learning as much as they can about whom a patient has been in contact with, so they can be notified about their potential exposure. While it does raise some privacy concerns, contact tracing has been used to slow the spread of other diseases, such as SARS and HIV.

Viral posts on social media falsely claim that a House bill would “give the government the power to forcibly remove” children from their homes. That’s not true. The bill actually provides $100 billion to fund COVID-19 contact tracing efforts. The bill — the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act — outlines a $100 billion program to be managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to award grants to “eligible entities,” such as health centers and clinics, universities and nonprofit organizations. The federal money would be used by those organizations “to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19, to trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals, and to support the quarantine of such contacts, through— (1) mobile health units; and (2) as necessary, testing individuals and providing individuals with services related to testing and quarantine at their residences.” Those provisions support the concept of contact tracing, a public health technique that, as we’ve previously explained, involves identifying those who have had contact with an infected person so that those people can be warned and ideally tested or quarantined.",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/false-claim-of-forced-removals-under-contact-tracing-bill/,5/13/2020,"Facebook, Thoughtcrime Mafia, Joshua Hawkins, YouTube, bbacle",,,,,,"Attempt to sow public distrust in US government legislation targeting the fighting of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially focusing on the idea of control of citizens and invasion of property, rights, safety, and children.",,,"Facebook, YouTube","https://www.facebook.com/Thoughtcrimemafia/photos/a.704069283074362/1695808290567118/?type=3&theater, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gded3VkmY8&feature=youtu.be&t=164, https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2935690066480849&set=a.206953702687846&type=3&theater",

What's False: This position has not been endorsed by the Italian government as a whole. In May 2020, a video started to circulate online that supposedly showed an Italian politician calling for the arrest of Bill Gates, the former Microsoft CEO who has been at the center of several conspiracy theories due to his foundation’s work to develop a vaccine for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. This video was frequently shared on social media with the caption, “Italian Government call for arrest of Bill Gates”. This is a genuine video of an Italian politician calling for Gates’ arrest. However, a single politician’s opinion does not equate to the entire Italian government calling for action. In fact, this view has been condemned by Italian government officials (one can hear this politician being told “enough” and to be quiet during the video).",https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/italy-bill-gates-arrest/,5/18/2020,YouTube,,,,,,Calling for the arrest of BIll Gates.,,,YouTube,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_etNclOGeng&feature=youtu.be,
The government in Oklahoma is planning to detain people unless they can show proof of vaccination.,False Claim,"The false claim is: ""The government in Oklahoma is planning to detain people unless they can show proof of vaccination."" This is false. In mid-May 2020, Facebook users began circulating a years-old video in which a man claimed the government was scheming to forcibly round up unvaccinated people. The video circulated widely without any indication as to when it was filmed and with the words “Heads up Oklahoma” edited in, leading some to think it pertained to the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic, specifically in the state of Oklahoma. The video, which has been on YouTube since 2009, featured Greg Evensen, a blogger who described himself as a former Kansas State Trooper. In the video, Evensen discussed a government “edict of mandated vaccinations.” Evensen’s comments appear to be a variation on a cross between two long-standing conspiracy theories. One theory centers on the mass detention of Americans — in most iterations the detention is to take place in camps created by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). And the other theory centers on activists who believe vaccines are harmful, and that a nefarious conspiracy exists to force them on the public. His remarks were made during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic of 2009. Because the video was made in 2009 and has nothing to do with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (for which there is no vaccine, anyway, as of this writing), and because the statements made in the video allude to unfounded conspiracies that have not come to pass, Snopes rated this claim “False.”",https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/conspiracy-video/,5/15/2020,"YouTube, FireThunderTV",,,,,,Attempt to spread conspiracy theories about forced vaccinations and micro-chip implants.,,,YouTube,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdjz8nroMUU&feature=youtu.be,

You should wear gloves in public to protect against COVID-19.,False Claim,"The false claim is: ""You should wear gloves in public to protect against COVID-19."" This is false. No, you should not be wearing gloves in public. The glove guidance for the general public is simple from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Don’t. “CDC doesn’t recommend the general public use gloves. Gloves can be a source of contamination, even for the wearer, if not properly removed,” spokeswoman Kate Grusich said in an email. “COVID-19 spreads through respiratory droplets that can land on surfaces. If the wearer touches a variety of surfaces during the day while wearing the same pair of gloves, contamination can definitely be transmitted from one surface to another.” The CDC’s online guide for glove use recommends wearing them when cleaning or caring for someone who is sick. It expressly notes gloves are a bad choice for running errands. “The best way to protect yourself from germs when running errands and after going out is to regularly wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol,” the website says.",https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/fact-check-no-you-should-not-be-wearing-gloves-in-public/ar-BB142O3G,5/13/2020,Verbal,,,,,,Misconception about the effectiveness of gloves in protecting against COVID-19.,,,Verbal,,

Be wary of companies you've never heard of or that call or send you emails out of the blue.
